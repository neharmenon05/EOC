# HACK CPU & Gray Code Display System

A two-part digital systems project built as part of the *Elements of Computing Systems* course at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

---

## Part A: 16-bit HACK CPU (Nand2Tetris)

Built using basic NAND gates and HDL via the Nand2Tetris platform.  
Key modules include:

- ALU, Registers, Program Counter, Instruction & Data Memory  
- Supports A-type and C-type instructions  
- Tested and simulated for correctness and execution cycle tracing  

---

## Part B: Gray Code to 7-Segment Display

Converts rotary encoder Gray code to readable output:

- Gray-to-Binary → Binary-to-Decimal → 7-Segment Mapping  
- Uses logic gates and truth tables with K-map optimization  
- Real-time position display for applications in robotics and automation
